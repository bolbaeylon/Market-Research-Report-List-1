<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Roughness Measurement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Noncontact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface roughness measurement is categorized into two main types: contact and non-contact methods. Contact measurement involves physically probing the surface with a stylus, which traces the surface profile to determine roughness. In contrast, non-contact methods use techniques such as laser scanning or optical systems to assess surface characteristics without direct interaction. Each method has its advantages; contact methods are often more precise for small-scale surfaces, while non-contact methods offer speed and the ability to measure delicate or soft materials without causing damage.</p></p>
